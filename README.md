GPU Stats Report
=======================

Polls GPU information and reports it to Datadog.

Each GPU on the machine is reported separately, though not all GPUs support reporting all stats through the exposed APIs

**Only supports nVidia hardware** though feel free to make a pull-request with support for other GPU manufacturers
